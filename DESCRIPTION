Description: Provides tools to work with the Flexible Dirichlet
    distribution. The main features are an E-M algorithm for computing the maximum
    likelihood estimate of the parameter vector and a function based on conditional
    bootstrap to estimate its asymptotic variance-covariance matrix. It contains
    also functions to plot graphs, to generate random observations and to handle
    compositional data.
